Hi Users!
Git

What is Git? Git is a system where you can create projects of different sizes with speed and efficiency. It helps you manage code, communicate and collaborate on different software projects. Git will allow you to go back to a previous status on a project or to see its entire evolution since the project was created. You could think of it as a time machine which will allow you to go back in time to whenever you’d like in your project. With Git, 3 basic issues were solved when working on projects:

    It became easier to manage large projects.
    It helps you avoid overwriting the team’s advances and work.
    With git, you just pull the entire code and history to your machine, so you can calmly work in your own little space without interference or boundaries. It's much simpler and much more light-weight.
